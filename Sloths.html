	<h1>Sloths</h1>
	<hr>

	<p>Sloths are my spirit animal. Sloths are highly successful arboreal mammals noted for their slow-movement. They spend their lives hanging about the rainforests of Central and South America. There are main types of sloth, two-toed and three-toed. Sloths have an extremely slow metabolic rate. Their diet consists mostly of low-energy,toxic leaves; it can take a sloth up to a month to completely digest a single leaf. Sloths have multi-chambered stomachs which take up a a third of their total body weight. 
	They spend up to 60% of their time at rest, digesting their food. Their sluggish nature also helps them avoid detection by their main predators, hawks and large cats. While many sloth species are able to swim, today's sloths are mostly helpless on the ground. In ancient times, giant land sloths roamed the earth. The Megatherium was the size of an elephant. </p>
